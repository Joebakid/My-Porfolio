        alt="Bawo Frontend CLI significance"
        text="Typing one command to bootstrap a production-ready React app changes how fast you can move. This post explains why the command npx create-bawo-frontend my-app matters, the problem it solves, and when to use it."
        subtitle1="What problem does it solve?"
        subtitletext1="Spinning up a new React project used to mean an hour of repetitive setup: Vite config, Tailwind wiring, folder layout, linting, formatting, and README scaffolding. The CLI collapses all of that into a single action with sensible defaults so you can start building immediately."

        <BlogSection
          title="1. The real bottleneck: project setup, not coding"
          content="Most beginners and teams lose momentum in the first hour—choosing stacks, wiring CSS, copying boilerplate, then fixing tiny config errors. Consistency suffers across repos. The CLI eliminates that friction with one opinionated, repeatable setup."
        />

        <BlogSection
          title="2. What the command actually does"
          content="It scaffolds a ready-to-run React + Vite + Tailwind starter with clean structure, scripts, and documentation. You get a predictable folder layout, basic pages/components, and DX niceties (eslint/prettier options, git init, and a clear README) so you can code features, not configs."
        />

        <BlogSection
          title="3. Why npx (and not a global install)?"
          content="npx runs the latest published version of the generator without polluting your global environment. No need to remember npm i -g or to keep a global package in sync—just run the command and you’re on the freshest version every time."
        />

        <BlogSection
          title="4. Quick start"
          content={`Run the generator:

npx create-bawo-frontend my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev

That’s it — you’re in a live dev server with a clean baseline.`}
        />

        <BlogSection
          title="5. Opinionated, but flexible"
          content="The defaults are curated for modern React: Vite for speed, Tailwind for styling, a tidy src/ with components and pages, and scripts that work out of the box. You can personalize from there—add libraries, swap state managers, or bring your own UI kit."
        />

        <BlogSection
          title="6. Team benefits: consistency & DX"
          content="New teammates ramp faster because every project looks the same. Linting and formatting reduce PR noise. A standard README shortens onboarding. The command turns “how do we set this up?” into “what are we shipping this week?”"
        />

        <BlogSection
          title="7. What you get (at a glance)"
          content={`my-app/
  src/
    App.(tsx|jsx)
    main.(tsx|jsx)
    components/
  index.html
  package.json
  tailwind.config.js
  postcss.config.js
  README.md

Exact files may vary by options, but the baseline is predictable and production-oriented.`}
        />

        <BlogSection
          title="8. When to use it"
          content="Perfect for hackathons, MVPs, tutorials, internal tools, and any greenfield React app where you want sane defaults fast. If you need a highly custom build pipeline from scratch, you can still start here and tailor afterward."
        />

        <BlogSection
          title="9. How it compares"
          content="Versus manual setup: saves 30–60 minutes and avoids setup bugs. Versus generic scaffolds: tuned specifically for a React + Vite + Tailwind workflow with a clean developer experience and clear next steps."
        />

        <BlogSection
          title="10. The takeaway"
          content="npx create-bawo-frontend my-app isn’t just a command; it’s a workflow decision. It gives you speed, consistency, and a professional baseline so your energy goes into features that matter. The fewer decisions you make up front, the more you ship."
        />

        <BlogSection
          title="Call to action"
          content={`Try it now:

npx create-bawo-frontend my-app

Open the repo, skim the README, and start coding. If you hit any rough edges, iterate on the generator—your future projects (and teammates) will thank you.`}
