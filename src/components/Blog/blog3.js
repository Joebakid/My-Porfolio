        alt="React developer portfolio"
        text="Your portfolio is more than a showcase . it's proof that you know how to build. As a React developer, your portfolio can make or break your chances of landing that first interview. Here’s how to make yours stand out in a crowded field."
        subtitle1="Why Your Portfolio Matters"
        subtitletext1="In the world of frontend development, a polished, thoughtful portfolio can set you apart even more than your resume. Employers want to see that you can build something functional, attractive, and real. This guide will walk you through the essential elements of a standout React portfolio."

        <BlogSection
          title="1. Showcase Real-World Projects"
          content="Avoid only using tutorial clones or to-do apps. Build projects that solve actual problems or showcase interesting use cases like a weather dashboard, e-commerce product page, or blog CMS (Content Management System). Make sure each project has a live demo and source code on GitHub."
        />
        <BlogSection
          title="2. Focus on UI/UX and Responsiveness"
          content="You’re not just a coder ,you’re a creator of user experiences. Make sure your portfolio is clean, responsive, and visually appealing. Use modern CSS (e.g., Flexbox, Grid, Tailwind), and test across devices to make sure everything looks great on mobile too."
        />
        <BlogSection
          title="3. Highlight Your React Skills Clearly"
          content="Don’t just mention React , demonstrate how you use it. Show component-based architecture, props, state, hooks, and routing. If you're using tools like Redux, React Query, or Zustand, explain why. Employers want to see that you understand React deeply, not just use it."
        />
        <BlogSection
          title="4. Write Meaningful Project Descriptions"
          content="For each project, explain what it does, what tech you used, and why you built it. Mention any challenges you overcame or cool features you implemented. This shows your thinking process and communicates value better than just listing technologies."
        />
        <BlogSection
          title="5. Keep the Code Clean and Public"
          content="Keep your GitHub repos organized. Use clear commit messages, clean folder structures, and README files that explain setup and usage. Bonus: pin your best projects on your GitHub profile to highlight them."
        />
        <BlogSection
          title="6. Add a Personal Touch"
          content="Include a short bio, your developer journey, and maybe even a blog section. Share your passions—like accessibility, performance, or design systems. Make it personal so recruiters remember you as a person, not just another resume."
        />
        <BlogSection
          title="7. Optimize for Performance and SEO"
          content="Use tools like Lighthouse to test load speed and performance. Add basic SEO tags—titles, meta descriptions, and Open Graph tags—to help your projects show up in search and social previews."
        />
        <BlogSection
          title="8. Make It Easy to Contact You"
          content="Include a contact form or link to your email and LinkedIn. Make sure CTAs (calls to action) like 'Hire Me' or 'Let’s Work Together' are visible and inviting."
        />
        <BlogSection
          title="Conclusion"
          content="A great React portfolio is more than a collection of projects—it's a reflection of your skills, creativity, and attention to detail. Build it with care, keep it updated, and let it grow with your experience. Your next opportunity might just come from someone browsing it."
